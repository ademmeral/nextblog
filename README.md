# NEXTBLOG

Nextblog (the name might change in the future) is a medium like BlogApp where author can write, editors can edit users can interact with a particular article. Reads, which are calculated by [Reading Observer](https://github.com/ademmeral/XReact/tree/main/context/XRReadingObserver), increase when 5 minutes is completed. That setting might change over time (depends on me).

> **Note** : The server-side API is not shared, as it is individual.
